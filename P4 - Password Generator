#Write a Python program to create a password, declare a string of numbers + uppercase + lowercase + special characters.
#Take a random sample of the string of a length given by the user

Method#
#first import the random module in Python. Then ask for user input for the length of the password.
#Store the letters, numbers and special characters that I want to be considered while generating a password
#I am doing a random sampling by joining the length of the password and the variable s, which will finally generate a random password

#Code
import random
passlen = int(input("enter the length of password"))
s="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*()?"
p = "".join(random.sample(s,passlen ))
print(p)
